"""
Double-click entry point for Wardrobe on Windows — starts the Flask server
silently in the background (no console window at all, since .pyw files run
under pythonw.exe) and opens it in your default browser.

Replaces the old Start Wardrobe.bat, which always ran in a visible terminal
window (that's inherent to .bat files) and started the server via plain
python.exe, which keeps its own console window around too (just minimized).
This launches everything through pythonw.exe instead, so no terminal ever
appears — same approach as URTO's launch_desktop.pyw.

If Wardrobe is already running (e.g. you double-clicked the icon twice, or
a previous session is still up), this just opens the browser tab instead of
starting a second server.
